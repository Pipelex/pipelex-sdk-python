"""Extract `mthds` release notes for the versions a bump crosses.

Reads the sibling `mthds-python` checkout's CHANGELOG.md and prints every
released section strictly after ``old_version`` up to and including
``new_version``.

Three boundaries this exists to get right:

- ``## [Unreleased]`` is never printed. It describes work that is *not* in the
  version being pinned. Quoting it in this repo's changelog is a plain factual
  error about what the upgrade contains -- and in this pairing it is a live
  hazard rather than a theoretical one, because `mthds-python`'s working tree is
  routinely ahead of PyPI.
- The old floor's own section is excluded (it was already in effect) while the
  new one's is included.
- A checkout that predates the target release cannot answer, and says so instead
  of printing a plausible-looking short range.

Exits non-zero with an explanation when the checkout cannot answer. Fall back to
``gh release view v<new> --repo mthds-ai/mthds-python`` in that case.
